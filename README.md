# Periodic Item Spawner
## Highly customizable Minecraft Datapack focusing on Giving a Random Item every X seconds.

This is my second datapack, therefore very poorly made. This datapack uses loot tables to randomize the items, which may or may not cause performance issues, however from my testing it doesn't impact much alone. To view all possible items go [item_pool.json]() to The Datapack features the following commands:

* /function pis:give_timer {Timer:x} - x=ticks before next mob spawn

This datapack has been tested and works in following versions:

* 1.21.4

## How to install this datapack
It's very simple! Just follow these instructions:
1. Download the PeriodicItemSpawner.zip from releases.
2. Unzip the zipped folder.
3. Go to ".minecraft\saves\yourworld\datapacks" and drag the datapack in there. 
3. Alternatively, you can create a new world in-game, go to "More", click on "Data Packs" and drag the datapack in there.

The Datapack will begin as soon as you join the world, to disable/enable the datapack run:

* /datapack disable "file/Periodic Item Spawner"
* /datapack enable "file/Periodic Item Spawner"

## Found a bug?
You can do the one of the following:

* Submit an issue detailing what occured, how it occured and or if you modified the datapack in any way. 
* DM me on discord (username: meilaleinalainen).
* Try to fix it yourself. This datapack is poorly made so I wouldn't recommend this option.
